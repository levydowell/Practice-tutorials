            <li>
                <a href="https://www.bridgerbrewing.com/" target="_blank">Bridger Brewing</a>
                <p>If you are looking for delicious pizza and a craft beer, all for an affordable price, look no farther! Plus from the deck you have an amazing view of the Bridger Mountains!</p>

            <li>
                <a href="https://daves-sushi.com/" target="_blank">Daves Sushi</a>
                <p>I know what you're thinking. While Montana is a great distance from any ocean, modern supply chain has made delivery of fresh food products very rapid. The sushi here is worth a try! The atmosphere is also very energetic! You are sure to have a good time!</p>

                <p>Last but not least is Sir Scott's Oasis. This place is a small drive from Bozeman, but is an absolute must if you are a lover of all things steak!</p>
